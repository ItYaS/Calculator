# Hello!
This is just a calculator.

On one day my brother and I had an argument about whether I could write a calculator in 2 hours. In June 18th 2020, I wrote it, but due to the fact that I used the conditions and checks, my window was closed after the result was displayed.
It took 5 hours (if you count hours in a row) and here it is.
Today is June 21, 2020.

If you want to transfer it with a picture to your desktop, make it a shortcut, and the shortcut put a picture.
